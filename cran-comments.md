## Resubmission 
11/08/2021
- Streamlined the notification
- use exist("agp/crp", dataset) instead of !all(is.na(dataset$agp/crp)) to suppress warning messages

## Resubmission
11/09/2021
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
- Reduced the title to 65 characters
- Added description
- Added DOI (the DOI checks showed "Found the following (possibly) invalid DOIs:", but the DOI is actually valid)
